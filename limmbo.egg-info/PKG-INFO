Description: # LiMMBo
        
        LiMMBo enables multivariate analysis of high-dimensional phenotypes based on
        linear mixed models with bootstrapping (LiMMBo). LiMMBo is available as an open
        source Python module. It builds on and can be used in combination with
        [LIMIX](https://github.com/limix/limix), a flexible and efficient linear mixed
        model library with interfaces to Python.
        
        A description of the public interface can be found [here
        ](https://limmbo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
        
        ## Install
        
        LiMMBo is available on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org).
        LiMMBo is dependent on Limix [LIMIX](https://github.com/limix/limix), however
        the latest Limix release does not include multi-variate models (see[issue 7](https://github.com/HannahVMeyer/limmbo/issues/7)).
        While waiting for the updated Limix release please install as follows:
        
        Install LIMIX with multi-variate support (v1.0.18):
        ```bash
        pip3 install "limix<2"
        ```
        
        After successful installation of LIMIX, simply install LiMMBo via
        ```bash
        pip3 install limmbo
        ```
        Recently, an R wrapper package for limmbo was created - this independent project
        can be found [here](https://github.com/fboehm/limmbo2).
